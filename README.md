# LookML CI/CD Pipeline: Complete Analysis

## Pipeline Overview
CI/CD pipeline is a comprehensive LookML Validation Pipeline that automatically tests and validates LookML code changes. It runs on GitHub Actions and performs 5 different types of validation to ensure code quality, functionality, and reliability.

## Trigger Events
The pipeline runs on:
* Pull Requests to main, master, or develop branches
* Direct pushes to main or master branches
* Only when LookML-related files are changed (.lkml, .lookml, .view, etc.)
  
## File Structure & Responsibilities

### Main Workflow File
- `.github/workflows/lookml-validation.yml`: The orchestrator that defines the entire pipeline flow

### Validation Scripts (Python)
* `looker-validator.py`: LookML syntax validation using Looker API
* `lookml-linter.py`: Custom coding standards and best practices checker
* `sql-execution-validator.py`: Tests actual SQL execution against databases
* `lookml-data-tests.py`: Runs LookML data tests and model validation
* `lookml-content-validator.py`: Validates Looker content (dashboards, looks)

### Utility Scripts
* `report-generator.py`: Creates comprehensive validation reports
* `check-results.py`: Determines overall pipeline success/failure

### Configuration Files
* `linting-rules.yaml`: Defines coding standards and validation rules
* `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies
* `looker-config.ini.template`: Template for Looker API configuration

## Pipeline Steps Breakdown

### Step 1: Environment Setup
- Checkout code (fetch-depth: 0 for full history)
- Setup Python 3.9
- Cache pip dependencies for performance
- Install Python packages from requirements.txt
- Configure Looker API credentials from GitHub secrets

### Step 2: Change Detection
- Uses `tj-actions/changed-files@v44` to detect modified LookML files
- If no LookML files changed, pipeline skips validation steps
- Displays list of changed files for transparency

### Step 3: LookML Syntax Validation
Script: `looker-validator.py`
- Purpose: Validates LookML syntax using official Looker API
- Process:
  - Authenticates with Looker API
  - Runs project validation for bi_sandbox
  - Handles both 200 (with errors) and 204 (success) responses
  - Falls back to manifest.lkml validation if project not found
- Output: `validation_results.json`
- Blocking: ❌ YES (pipeline fails if syntax errors found)

### Step 4: Custom LookML Linting
Script: `lookml-linter.py`
- Purpose: Enforces coding standards and best practices
- Checks:
  - Mandatory fields: Ensures dimensions/measures have required properties (label, description, type)
  - Naming conventions: Enforces snake_case, boolean prefixes (is_, has_)
  - Performance rules: Detects SELECT *, excessive nesting
  - Security rules: Identifies potential hardcoded secrets, PII without access filters
- Configuration: Rules defined in linting-rules.yaml
- Output: `linting_results.json`
- Blocking: ❌ YES (errors fail pipeline, warnings don't)

### Step 5: SQL Execution Testing
Script: `sql-execution-validator.py`
- Purpose: Tests that SQL actually executes against real databases
- Process:
  - Extracts SQL from derived tables in LookML files
  - Uses 2-step Looker API workflow:
    - Create SQL query (POST /api/4.0/sql_queries)
    - Execute query (POST /api/4.0/sql_queries/{slug}/run/json)
  - Detects database connections from model files
  - Tests SQL syntax, table existence, permissions
- Advanced Features:
  - Handles multiline SQL formatting
  - Detects connection from model files or derived_table
  - Parses execution results for hidden errors (even with 200 status)
- Output: `sql_validation_results.json`
- Blocking: ❌ YES (SQL execution errors fail pipeline)

### Step 6: LookML Data Tests
Script: `lookml-data-tests.py`
- Purpose: Validates LookML tests and model integrity
- Process:
  - Runs model validation for all models in project
  - Validates explore definitions
  - Checks LookML test definitions (like in case21_tests.lkml)
  - Verifies model-explore relationships
- Tests Your Cases:
  - `org_value_value_check`: Tests value > 0
  - `org_value_dep_length_check`: Tests department length = 5
  - `org_value_depid_notnull_check`: Tests NOT NULL constraints
  - `dep_a_good_number_limit`: Tests total_number < 10000
- Output: `data_tests_results.json`
- Blocking: ⚠️ PARTIAL (continues on error, but affects final status)

### Step 7: Content Validation
Script: `lookml-content-validator.py`
- Purpose: Validates Looker content (dashboards, looks) in BI Sandbox folder
- Process:
  - Uses Looker's content validation API
  - Filters results for "BI Sandbox" folder only
  - Checks dashboard elements, scheduled plans, alerts
  - Validates content dependencies and model references
- Output: `content_validation_results.json`
- Blocking: ⚠️ NO (allows pipeline to continue with warnings)

### Step 8: Report Generation 📋
Script: `report-generator.py`
- Purpose: Creates comprehensive validation reports
  - Generates:
  - GitHub Actions step summary (visible in workflow)
  - PR comment with detailed results and status icons
  - Markdown summary file
- Features:
  - Status icons (✅ ❌ ⚪) for each validation step
  - Error details with file paths and line numbers
  - Performance metrics (execution times, query counts)

### Step 9: Artifact Upload & Results Check
- Uploads: All JSON results and summary files to GitHub
- Retention: 30 days for debugging and history
- Final Check: check-results.py determines overall success/failure

### Step 10: PR Commenting 💬
- Updates existing PR comments or creates new ones
- Shows validation status with visual indicators
- Provides direct links to detailed workflow results

## Output Artifacts
Each validation step produces detailed JSON results:
1. `validation_results.json` - LookML syntax validation
2. `linting_results.json` - Coding standards results
3. `sql_validation_results.json` - SQL execution test results
4. `data_tests_results.json` - LookML data tests results
5. `content_validation_results.json` - Content validation results
6. `validation_summary.md` - Human-readable summary
7. `pr_comment.md` - PR comment content

## Error Handling & Resilience
### Blocking vs Non-Blocking Steps
- Blocking (Pipeline Fails): Syntax errors, linting errors, SQL execution errors
- Non-Blocking (Warnings Only): Content validation issues, some data test failures

### Error Categories
- Syntax Errors: Malformed LookML, missing required fields
- Execution Errors: SQL that fails to run, missing tables/permissions
- Content Errors: Broken dashboards, invalid model references
- Security Errors: Hardcoded secrets, unprotected PII fields
